For example, write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:

1. a method that returns the sum of two integers
2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element
 
-------------------------

casual psuedo code 

1. 

take two integer inputs
multiply one integer by the other

START

GET two integers
SET integer1 and integer2
SET result = sum of integer1 and integer2
PRINT results

END

2. 

START

GET array of integers
